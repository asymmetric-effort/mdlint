# MD1000: Maximum Line Length

Enforces a maximum number of characters per line in Markdown files. Lines exceeding the configured limit trigger a finding.

## Configuration

```yaml
MD1000:
  line_length: 80        # Maximum allowed characters per line
  code_blocks: false     # If true, check lines inside fenced code blocks
  tables: false          # If true, check lines inside tables
```

## Examples

With `line_length: 10`:

```markdown
This line is fine
This line is definitely too long
```

The second line produces:

```
README.md:2:11 MD1000 Line exceeds maximum length of 10 characters
```

Setting `code_blocks: true` or `tables: true` enables checking inside those structures.
